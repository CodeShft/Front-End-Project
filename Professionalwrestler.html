                    <h2>Professional wrestling career</h2>
                    <p class="p">
                        Dwayne Johnson continued to play defensive tackle at the University of Miami and enjoyed a good
                        few years of success. He was later signed by the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football
                        League.
                        However, multiple injuries and lack of playing time resulted in him being cut by Calgary, and he
                        decided to follow in his father’s footsteps to become a professional wrestler.
                        Johnson had a gift for speaking and used it to his advantage in wrestling.
                        Initially, Johnson was billed as Rocky Maivia and quickly climbed his way to the top of the
                        World Wrestling Federation (WWF).
                        Johnson competed in WrestleMania 13 on March 23, 1997, and defended his Intercontinental
                        Championship against The Sultan. After more victories, fans began turning on Johnson, and he was
                        often welcomed to boos and chants of “die, Rocky, die” and “Rocky Sucks.”
                        However, everything changed after Johnson, then Maivia, lost his title to Owen Hart in Raw Is
                        War. He returned several months later due to a knee injury and turned heel for the first time.
                        Johnson began calling him the “Rock” and regularly insult the audience, fellow performers and
                        interviewers.
                        The Rock feuded with Steve “Stone Cold” Austin, Triple H and Ken Shamrock in the late 90s.
                        The Rock won multiple WWF championships and skyrocketed in popularity. He is considered the most
                        accomplished and recognized pro-wrestlers today. His impressive (269-163-40) record speaks for
                        itself.
                        The Rock continued to wrestle occasionally in the mid to late 2000s and often made surprise
                        appearances. He permanently retired from professional wrestling on August 3, 2019.
