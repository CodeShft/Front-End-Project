                        <h2>Biography</h2>
                        <p class="p">Dwayne Douglas Johnson (born May 2, 1972), also known by his ring name the Rock, is
                            an American actor, film producer, and retired professional wrestler. Widely regarded as one
                            of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, he was integral to the development and
                            success of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) during the Attitude Era, an
                            industry boom period in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Johnson wrestled for the WWF for
                            eight years before pursuing an acting career. His films have grossed over $3.5 billion in
                            North America and over $10.5 billion worldwide, making him one of the world's
                            highest-grossing and highest-paid actors. After accepting an athletic scholarship to play
                            football at the University of Miami, he was a member of the 1991 national championship team,
                            but was largely a backup player. Despite aspirations to professional football, he went
                            undrafted in the 1995 NFL draft, and briefly signed with the Calgary Stampeders before being
                            cut in his first season.In 1996, Johnson's father Rocky assisted in helping him secure a
                            contract with the WWF. Johnson quickly rose to global prominence, aided by a gimmick he
                            employed as a charismatic trash talker. Johnson left the WWE in 2004 and returned in 2011 as
                            a part-time performer until 2013, making sporadic appearances until retiring in 2019. A
                            10-time world champion, including the promotion's first of African-American descent,he is

                            Rumble winner, and WWE's sixth Triple Crown champion. Johnson headlined the most-bought
                            professional wrestling pay-per-view (WrestleMania XXVIII) and was featured among the most
                            watched episodes of WWE's flagship television series (Raw and SmackDown).Johnson's first
                            film role was in The Mummy Returns (2001). The next year, he played his first leading role
                            in the action fantasy film The Scorpion King. He has since starred in family films The Game
                            Plan (2007), Race to Witch Mountain (2009), Tooth Fairy (2010), Jumanji: Welcome to the
                            Jungle (2017), Jumanji: The Next Level (2019), and Jungle Cruise (2021), and the action
                            films Journey 2: The Mysterious Island (2012), G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013), Hercules
                            (2014), Skyscraper (2018), San Andreas (2015) and Rampage (2018). He also starred in the

                            DC Extended Universe playing the title role in Black Adam (2022). He is also known for
                            voicing Maui in the Disney animated film Moana (2016) and is set to reprise the role in the
                            upcoming live action remake. Johnson produced and starred in the HBO comedy-drama series
                            Ballers (2015–2019) and the autobiographical sitcom Young Rock (2021). His autobiography,
                            The Rock Says, was released in 2000 and was a New York Times bestseller. In 2012, he

                            co-owner of the XFL, a professional American football league, which he acquired from WWE
                            owner Vince McMahon for $15 million in 2020. In 2016 and 2019, Time named Johnson one of the
                            world's most influential people.
                        <h2>Early life</h2>
                        Johnson was born in Hayward, California, on May 2, 1972,the son of Ata Johnson (née Maivia) and
                        former professional wrestler Rocky Johnson (born Wayde Douglas Bowles). Growing up, he briefly
                        lived in Grey Lynn in Auckland, New Zealand, with his mother's family, where he played rugby and
                        attended Richmond Road Primary School before returning to the U.S.Johnson's father was a Black
                        Nova Scotian with a small amount of Irish ancestry.His mother is Samoan. His father and Tony
                        Atlas were the first black tag team champions in WWE history, in 1983. His mother is the adopted
                        daughter of Peter Maivia, who was also a professional wrestler. Johnson's maternal
                        grandmother Lia was one of the first female pro wrestling promoters, taking over Polynesian
                        Pacific Pro Wrestling after her husband's death in 1982 and managing it until 1988. Through his
                        maternal grandfather Maivia, Johnson is a non-blood relative of the Anoa'i wrestling family. In
                        2008, he inducted his father and grandfather into the WWE Hall of Fame.
                        Johnson attended Montclaire Elementary School in Charlotte, North Carolina, before moving to
                        Hamden, Connecticut, where he attended Shepherd Glen Elementary School and then Hamden Middle
                        School. He attended President William McKinley High School in Honolulu and then Glencliff High
                        School and McGavock High School, both in Nashville, and then Freedom High School in Bethlehem
                        Township in the Lehigh Valley, from which he graduated in 1990.At Freedom High School, Johnson
                        initially struggled and was drawn into a culture of conflict and petty crime. By age 17, he had
                        been arrested several times for fighting, theft, and check fraud, and was suspended two weeks
                        for fighting. The local newspaper later called him "a troubled teenager with a history of
                        run-ins with police." But Freedom High School football coach Jody Cwik saw athletic potential in
                        Johnson, and recruited him to join the football team, where he played defensive tackle. The
                        experience proved the beginning of a personal transformation for Johnson. "My thought process
                        started to change. That's when I started thinking about goals and what I wanted to accomplish",
                        he has since said about his high school football experience. In addition to playing football,
                        Johnson also was a member of Freedom High School's track and field and wrestling teams.By his
                        senior year, Johnson had played only two years of football, but was offered a full athletic
                        scholarship offer from the University of Miami.</p>
